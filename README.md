# Dream Emerald

## WORK IN PROGRESS

I have been wanting to make my own hack of Pokémon Emerald for years and I decided to why not begin to work on it. For the time being it's just a lame git copy of pokeemerald Expansion with some added features.

### Fakemon
* **Dark Ralts** line

#### Abilities
* **Dark Power**: Normal attacks become Dark

#### Moves
* **Psychic Inversion**: Super-effective on Dark Pokémon. Might cause flinch.

### Quality Of Life Changes
* Run indoors
* Poison Fades at 1HP and Lowers Friendship
* "Run" in water
* No need for Move Deleter for HMs
* Summary Screen Nature stats are coloured, IVs and EVs appear by pressing A Button
* Summary Screen wraps to first/last pokémon (hate this wasn't a default)
* Easily swap between lower and upper case with R Button in the Naming screen.
* Switches to lowercase after inputting the first character
* Expiring a Repel will prompt the use of another one

### Features/Changes
* **Bug Type** rebalanced
* **Ice Type** rebalanced
* **Sound Type** added
* Default Text Speed to Fast
* Default Sound to Stereo
* Wild Pokémon will drop their items after fainting
* 15% Chance to find a double wild Pokémon encounter

#### Planned for sure
* Rebalancing Pokémon that need it
* Starter Pokémon will change
* Map will have a few new areas
* New Rival
* Can catch All Pokémon up to Gen 5. Some Up-to-Gen 8 Pokémon will be around too
* Checking up Steel Type for rebalance
* Soft EXP Cap
* Fakémon, original
* Fakémon(?), type variations (like Psychic/Dark Ralts line, Grass/Sound Oddish line, etc.)

### Schedule
* I'm just working on this **for fun**, I'm not gonna promise anything at anytime

### Known Bugs
**Visual**
* When switching a Pokémon in a Double Wild Encounter, if that Pokémon levels up and can learn a new move, the summary screen will glitch showing one of the Wild Pokémon instead

#### Possible Bugs/Not Intended
* Does Friendship lower correctly after the Poison Fades?
* Does Sound type work correctly?
* Sound Pokémon should never fall asleep
* Extrasensory effect is weird
* Leveling a mon in a double battle sometimes freezes the game if you didn't read its pokédex prior to that?

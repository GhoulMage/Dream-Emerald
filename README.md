# Dream Emerald

## WORK IN PROGRESS

I have been wanting to make my own hack of Pokémon Emerald for years and I decided to why not begin to work on it.
I progressed quite and I could say it's about one quarter done, most of it is map stuff and events.

* Last README Update: **October 19th 2024**

### Features/Changes
* Many type rebalances and changes, cant put them all here. Most notably:

* Wild Pokémon will drop their items after fainting
* 15% Chance to find a double wild Pokémon encounter
* Mostly updated to Gen 9 mechanics, though some will be older because I want

* Overworld Snow starts **Hail Weather** in battle
    * Will probably be changed to **Snow Weather** once it's implemented.

* Pokémon might also appear in the overworld without being in tall grass, albeit rare.
* Caves's usual encounters are replaced by Cave Dust tiles that act like Tall Grass.
    * Planned to add a similar tile for Water.
* Pokémon can be Gay based on personality. This only affects Infatuation mechanics.
    * They also can be Ace, Pan and some entires species are Gay as well, but defined per-species.

#### Planned for sure
* Rebalancing Pokémon and Moves
* Starter Pokémon will change
* Map will have a few new areas
    * I also will redesign a few maps. For example, Fiery Path, Abandoned Ship or Pacifidlog. I've always thought they should be bigger.
* Some change to Rivals
    * Adding **LADY CINDY**, yes that one from Route 104. Had a silly little crush on her when I was a kid.
    * **WALLY**, more like, he'll be a better and more involved rival.
* Can catch All Pokémon up to Gen 5. Some Up-to-Gen 9 Pokémon will be around too
* Checking up Steel Type for rebalance
* Soft EXP Cap
* Fakémon, original
* Fakémon(?), type variations (like Psychic/Dark Ralts line, Grass/Sound Oddish line, etc.)
* New Abilities
* New Moves
* Some events might be different or ordered differently.
    * Mostly QoL things that I and my Gf nitpick.
    * Some lore might also be changed based on my interpretation. 
* New Ice status effect: Frostbite (not like Arceus - didn't even know it was already a thing before lol). Acts as a half way before a Pokémon can be Frozen.
* New "Weather" - Toxic Weather. Annoying hail/sandstorm-type weather that deals extra damage to Pokémon with a status effect.
    * Overworld effect is a must for this.
* I'll probably add a **Snow Weather** that doesn't damage non-ice Pokémon but does increase the Speed and Sp Def of Ice Pokémon.
    * This won't replace Hail.
* Generic Following Pokémon might be added, but I definitively want the main starter **Gardevoir Dark** to be following you around for most of the early to mid game.
* Secret Bases might be better and let your party roam around.

### Schedule
* I'm just working on this **for fun**, I'm not gonna promise anything at anytime.
    * You can find me, though, on RHH's discord server and @GhoulMage

### Known Bugs
* Fighting Stacy will glitch all sprites somehow after the 4th mon.
    * This is old so maybe it got fixed
* In the Options menu, the Run mode button pushes the Exit button outside of the range of options.
* Using Headbutt for the first time always shows the second mon in your party instead of the mon with Headbutt.
* In battle, double types do not properly blink between both types like they do in the summary screen.

#### Possible Bugs/Not Intended
* Does Friendship lower correctly after the Poison Fades?
* Sound Pokémon should never fall asleep
* Extrasensory effect is weird
* Leveling a mon in a double battle sometimes freezes the game if you didn't read its pokédex prior to that?

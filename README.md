# Dream Emerald

## WORK IN PROGRESS

I have been wanting to make my own hack of Pokémon Emerald for years and I decided to why not begin to work on it. For the time being it's just a lame git copy of pokeemerald Expansion with some added features.

### Schedule

### Known Bugs
**Visual**
* If a Pokémon levels up and can learn a new move, the summary screen will glitch showing either nothing, one of the Wild Pokémon, or the Pokémon with corrupted colors instead.

#### Possible Bugs/Not Intended
* Does Friendship lower correctly after the Poison Fades?
* Does Sound type work correctly?
* Matchups in Bug, Ice and Sound may be incorrect (have to check all of them yet ingame)
* Sound Pokémon should never fall asleep
* Extrasensory effect is weird
* Leveling a mon in a double battle sometimes freezes the game if you didn't read its pokédex prior to that?

### Known Bugs
**Visual**
* When switching a Pokémon in a Double Wild Encounter, if that Pokémon levels up and can learn a new move, the summary screen will glitch showing one of the Wild Pokémon instead

#### Possible Bugs/Not Intended
* Does Friendship lower correctly after the Poison Fades?
* Does Sound type work correctly?
* Matchups in Bug, Ice and Sound may be incorrect (have to check all of them yet ingame)
* Can Sound Pokémon fall asleep? (Shouldn't)

### Schedule
* I'm just working on this **for fun**, I'm not gonna promise anything at anytime


### Credits
* [pokeemerald decomp project (base)](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)
* [pokeemerald-expansion (extended)](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion)
* [PokéCommunity: Tutorials and guides in Decomp & Dissasembly Tutorials](https://www.pokecommunity.com/forumdisplay.php?f=475&order=desc)


### Known Bugs
**Visual**
* If a Pokémon levels up and can learn a new move, the summary screen will glitch showing either nothing, one of the Wild Pokémon, or the Pokémon with corrupted colors instead.

#### Possible Bugs/Not Intended
* Does Friendship lower correctly after the Poison Fades?
* Does Sound type work correctly?
* Matchups in Bug, Ice and Sound may be incorrect (have to check all of them yet ingame)
* Sound Pokémon should never fall asleep
* Extrasensory effect is weird
* Leveling a mon in a double battle sometimes freezes the game if you didn't read its pokédex prior to that?
